# Introduction

Team_18 is designing a calendar application that will allow for students to keep track of and prepare for assignments added to the program in a timely fashion. There will be an algorithm that sorts the assignments by grade-weight and due date and determines the best plan of completion. Students should be able to input categories for each of their classes as well as weighting for each category and then input assignments and points and drag to each category. The program should then be able to determine the optimal order of completion for each assignment based on weighting vs. time until due date.

If applicable, the assignment should be given an estimated time on assignment (an estimation of how long each assignment will take) to further increase the accuracy of the algorithm. Each class will be given a color, and each assignment will be shaded with said color. Students will be able to see, at a glance, the importance of each assignment by the hue that particular assignment has. As each assignment nears their due-date, the assignment hue will darken.

# Anticipated Problems

Programming an appropriate algorithm to determine the correct order to complete assignments.

# Functional Requirements

* The application shall allow the user to input assignments on a class-by-class basis.
* The application shall, using a grade-weight system, determine the optimal order of completion for the aforementioned assignments.
* The application shall allow the user to mark the aforementioned assignments as complete.
* The application shall allow the user to input weighting categories for each class.
* The application shall allow the user to drag inputted assignments into the aforementioned weighting categories.
* The application shall allow the user to input estimated time of completion for the inputted assignments.

# Non-Functional Requirements

* The application shall have a sleek, modern UI design.
* The application shall be user friendly and intuitive.
* The application shall be color coded
